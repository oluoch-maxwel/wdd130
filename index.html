        <p>Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya and one of the most important cities in East Africa.
            It is known as the “Green City in the Sun” because of its many parks and natural spaces.
            Nairobi is a center for business, education, and technology, and it is also home to
            Nairobi National Park, where wildlife exists close to the city. The city has a rich
            culture with people
            from many different communities living and working together.</p>
